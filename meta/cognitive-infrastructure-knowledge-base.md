# Cognitive Infrastructure Knowledge Base: Project Overview & PRD

## Executive Summary

This project aims to develop a comprehensive knowledge ecosystem for the field of Cognitive Infrastructure, combining an epistemically structured repository with advanced retrieval and contribution capabilities. The system will serve as both a canonical knowledge base and a recursive infrastructure that enables continuous evolution through human and AI collaboration.

The core innovation lies in creating not just content, but a structured architecture that maintains clarity, supports recursive improvement, and enables seamless contribution across human and machine agents.

## Project Vision

To create the definitive knowledge infrastructure for the field of Cognitive Infrastructure that:

1. Maintains epistemic clarity and coherence across all content
2. Enables recursive knowledge development through structured contribution
3. Supports AI-native and human-collaborative knowledge retrieval and synthesis
4. Provides civic-grade intelligence infrastructure as a public good

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of four integrated components:

1. **Canonical Knowledge Base**: Structured repository of concepts, patterns, anti-patterns, diagnostics, and source documents
2. **Meta Stack**: Schemas, tools, and protocols that maintain knowledge integrity
3. **Retrieval Architecture**: Advanced RAG system for epistemically-aware knowledge access
4. **Contribution Protocol**: Multi-interface system for human and AI contributions

These components operate across a multi-repository architecture that separates concerns while maintaining coherent integration.

# Cognitive Infrastructure Knowledge Ecosystem

## Overview

The Cognitive Infrastructure Knowledge Ecosystem is a comprehensive, recursive, epistemically-structured system for maintaining, evolving, and distributing the canonical knowledge of the Cognitive Infrastructure field. It combines a versioned knowledge repository with advanced retrieval capabilities and multi-agent contribution protocols to create a living, evolving intelligence infrastructure.

## System Architecture

The system is structured as four integrated components across multiple repositories:

### 1. Canonical Knowledge Base (`knowledge-base/`)

**Purpose:** House the authoritative content of the Cognitive Infrastructure field in an epistemically structured format.

**Components:**
- Core concepts directory (`/core-concepts/`)
- Patterns and anti-patterns directory (`/patterns-and-anti-patterns/`)
- Diagnostics directory (`/diagnostics/`)
- Canonical source documents (`/docs/canonical-source-documents/`)
- Source documents (`/docs/source-documents/`)
- JSON mirrors of all content (`/json/`)
- Metadata and summary documents (`/meta/`)

**Content Types:**
- Core concepts (e.g., Structural Debt, Modal Layer Architecture)
- Implementation patterns (e.g., Semantic Foundation, Clarity Culture)
- Anti-patterns (e.g., Dashboard Theater, Hero Syndrome)
- Diagnostics (e.g., System Autopsy, Cross-Boundary Triangulation)
- Frameworks and essays

**File Format:**
- Each canonical entity exists as twin `.md` and `.json` files
- Consistent frontmatter with id, status, version, and summary
- Structured body with sections appropriate to content type

### 2. Meta Stack (`meta-stack/`)

**Purpose:** Provide the tools, schemas, and protocols that maintain knowledge integrity and enable evolution.

**Components:**
- JSON schemas for validating content
- CLI tools for content generation and validation
- Scripts for cross-referencing and consistency checks
- Ontologies defining relationships between concepts
- Publishing protocols for content evolution

**Key Tools:**
- `ci-writer.js`: Content generation tool
- `ci-coder.js`: Validation and synchronization tool
- `ingest-pending.js`: Process draft documents into canonical format
- `update-related-sections.js`: Maintain cross-references

### 3. Retrieval Architecture (`rag-stack/`)

**Purpose:** Enable epistemically-structured knowledge retrieval for humans and AI agents.

**Components:**
- Epistemically-aware embedding system
- Vector database with concept-level indexing
- Retrieval API with filtering and relationship traversal
- Query expansion and recursive knowledge synthesis
- Client libraries and integration points

**Key Innovations:**
- Concept-aware embeddings that preserve epistemic relationships
- Recursive retrieval that follows concept links
- Knowledge-base-summary.md as context primer
- Type-aware filtering and retrieval

### 4. Contribution Protocol (`ci-contribute/`)

**Purpose:** Enable structured contributions from humans and AI agents while maintaining canonical integrity.

**Components:**
- Multi-interface submission system (GitHub, web form, API)
- Validation workflows for contributions
- Pending document queue and review system
- Canonicalization process
- Attribution and provenance tracking

**Workflow:**
1. Submit content via preferred interface
2. Auto-classify and extract metadata
3. Place in `/docs/pending/`
4. Run validation and cross-reference checks
5. Review and publish to appropriate location

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Recursive Augmented Retrieval Architecture (RARA)

Transforms traditional RAG into a structured, recursive, epistemically-aware knowledge engine.

**Key Requirements:**

**Technical Specifications:**
- Embeddings: OpenAI (`text-embedding-3-small`) or HuggingFace (`mpnet`)
- Vector store: Supabase + `pgvector` (preferred)
- Chunking strategy: Preserve epistemic units (no arbitrary window chunking)
- Standard embedding dimension: 1536
- Cross-linking embedding boost: Related concepts gain proximity

### 2. Public Retrieval API

Exposes Cognitive Infrastructure as a citable, canonical retrieval layer for external agents and applications.

**Key Requirements:**
- RESTful API endpoint for knowledge queries
- Support for filtering by content type
- Return both snippets and metadata
- Include relationship data for recursive traversal
- Support cross-references and related concepts
- Provide manifests for GPT and LLM plugin compatibility

**API Specifications:**

  ```json
  {
    "query": "How does semantic drift emerge?",
    "top_k": 10,
    "filters": ["core-concept", "anti-pattern"],
    "expand_relationships": true
  }
  ```
- Response format:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": "ci:anti-pattern.semantic-drift",
      "score": 0.92,
      "source": "anti-patterns/semantic-drift.md",
      "snippet": "...",
      "relatedConcepts": ["ci:core-concept.semantic-alignment"]
    }
  ]
  ```

### 3. Contribution Protocol

Enables any user or agent to submit canonical entries while preserving epistemic structure, validation, and attribution.

**Key Requirements:**
- Multiple interface options (GitHub PR, web form, API, GPT plugin)
- Structured templates for different content types
- Validation against JSON schemas
- Pending queue for review
- Attribution and provenance tracking
- Auto-classification and metadata extraction

**Contribution Schema:**
```json
{

    "type": "human|llm",
    "origin": "form|api|github|gpt",
    "attribution": "optional name or identifier"
  },
  "status": "pending"
}
```
