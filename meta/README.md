# Meta Documents

This directory contains meta-level documentation that describes the architecture, processes, and protocols of the Cognitive Infrastructure ecosystem.

## Available Documents

- [Recursive Publishing Engine](recursive-publishing-engine.md) - Self-description of the publishing automation system that generates, validates, and maintains the knowledge base.
- [Pending Ingestion Protocol](pending-ingestion-instruction.md) - Process for submitting, classifying, and integrating new content into the knowledge base.
- [Knowledge Base PRD](cognitive-infrastructure-knowledge-base.md) - Comprehensive Product Requirements Document for the Cognitive Infrastructure Knowledge Base, Retrieval Architecture, and Contribution Protocol.

## Purpose

Meta documents serve as self-description of the system's own architecture and processes. They provide the structural backbone for understanding how the knowledge ecosystem works, evolves, and maintains its integrity.

These documents follow the principle that any complex knowledge system must be able to describe its own architecture in order to remain coherent and evolvable over time.
