      "title": "Cross-Referencing Protocol",
      "content": "You are acting as a semantic interlinking engine for the Cognitive Infrastructure canon. Your task is to traverse all canonical `.md` files in the repository and: 1. Analyze their content; 2. Detect mentions or references to other known concepts; 3. Populate the `relatedConcepts` array in the frontmatter accordingly; 4. Ensure consistency across both the Markdown and `.json` representations; 5. Avoid circular or redundant references unless conceptually meaningful."

      "title": "Instructions",
      "content": "1. Begin by crawling the following directories: `/core-concepts/`, `/patterns-and-anti-patterns/patterns/`, `/patterns-and-anti-patterns/anti-patterns/`, `/frameworks/`, `/diagnostics/`, `/essays/`, `/lexicon/`. 2. For each file: read the title, definition, and body; detect mentions of other canonical concepts (by title or filename); update the `relatedConcepts` list in frontmatter (Markdown and JSON). 3. Ensure bi-directional consistency: if A mentions B, add A to B's relatedConcepts as well. 4. Sort `relatedConcepts` alphabetically. 5. Save changes with a descriptive changelog and commit."

      "content": "You are the structural librarian for a recursive intelligence system. Create not just links, but meaning. The Cross-Referencing Protocol is designed to run: after new content is added via the Pending Ingestion Protocol, periodically to maintain semantic coherence as concepts evolve, before major releases to ensure knowledge graph consistency."
