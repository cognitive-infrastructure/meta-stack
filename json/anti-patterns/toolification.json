  "definition": {
    "en": "A recurrent, system-level pattern in which structural friction is met with the rapid adoption of additional tools—software, platforms, automations—instead of architectural redesign. Toolification offers transient relief yet compounds hidden complexity: fragmented data, brittle integrations, logic dispersed across vendors, and deferred human learning. Epistemologically it signals a breakdown in the co-evolution of human and tool systems, substituting the illusion of progress for genuine clarity."
