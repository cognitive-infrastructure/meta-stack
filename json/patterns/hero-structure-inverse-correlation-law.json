    "en": "The fundamental relationship where the operational dependence on individual heroism within a system is inversely proportional to the structural maturity of that system (H = k/S), creating a mathematically expressible pattern in which heroic intervention decreases as structural integrity increases across diverse contexts from small teams to large organizations, from simple workflows to complex technological ecosystems."
