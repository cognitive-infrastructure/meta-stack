      "content": "Establish a self-scaling ingestion system with a dedicated staging area (like `/docs/pending/`) where draft documents can be submitted in a relatively unstructured form, then processed through a pipeline that:\n\n1. Classifies content by type and purpose\n2. Routes it to appropriate destinations\n3. Applies canonical structure and formatting\n4. Generates machine-readable representations\n5. Updates indices and cross-references"

      "content": "The implementation requires:\n\n- A staging directory for new content\n- Classification algorithms to determine content type\n- Transformation logic to apply canonical structure\n- Validation mechanisms to ensure quality\n- Cross-reference management to maintain relationships\n\n<!-- TODO: Add example code showing how to implement this pattern -->"
