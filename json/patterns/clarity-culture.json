  "title": "Clarity Culture",
  "author": "Rashid Azarang",
  "summary": "A framework for creating cultural practices that value and maintain structural clarity over time. Includes Cultural Foundations (Clarity Over Convenience, Truth Over Comfort, Structure Over Heroes, Evolution Over Stability) and Growing Clarity Practices (Regular System Autopsies, Architectural Storytelling, Capability Building, Embedded Governance).",
  "relatedConcepts": ["Operator's Oath", "System Autopsy", "Hero Syndrome"],
  "definition": "Clarity Culture is a framework for creating cultural practices that value and maintain structural clarity over time. It recognizes that sustainable operational intelligence requires more than technical implementationâ€”it needs cultural practices that deliberately cultivate and preserve architectural clarity as a shared value.",
  "problemSolved": [
    "Cultural Complacency: The assumption that initial cultural change will sustain itself without ongoing reinforcement, leading to gradual erosion of clarity practices",
    "Value Misalignment: The disconnect between stated architectural values and actual decision-making priorities in daily operations",
    "Invisible Degradation: The gradual, often imperceptible erosion of structural clarity through small compromises that accumulate over time",
    "Knowledge Dilution: The loss of architectural understanding as organizations grow and original clarity champions become diluted",
    "Heroic Temptation: The organizational tendency to celebrate crisis response rather than structural prevention",
    "Governance Friction: The perception of architectural guidance as bureaucratic impediment rather than enabler of sustainable capability"
