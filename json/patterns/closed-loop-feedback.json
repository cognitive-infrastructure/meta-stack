    "en": "For each critical metric, establish: 1) clear intervention thresholds, 2) predefined response protocols, 3) explicit ownership of action, and 4) verification mechanisms to confirm intervention effectiveness. Design feedback visualizations that incorporate both measure and response as a unified view."
