  "description": "A System Autopsy is a facilitated diagnostic ritual designed to expose the actual structure of operational systemsâ€”not as they appear in official documentation, but as they function in reality. Unlike process reviews focused on optimization, the Autopsy probes beneath surface symptoms to reveal architectural patterns that either support or undermine cognitive clarity.",
