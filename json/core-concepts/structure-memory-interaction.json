  "definition": {
    "en": "The SMI Triad defines how usable intelligence emerges from three essential components: organization of information (Structure), ability to access past states (Memory), and systems that continuously refine understanding through usage patterns (Interaction). Together, these create the necessary conditions for knowledge systems that retain clarity, learn, and evolve coherently over time."
