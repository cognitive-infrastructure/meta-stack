# Lib Directory

The `lib` directory contains shared libraries and utility functions used across the Cognitive Infrastructure project. These libraries provide common functionality that can be reused by various components of the meta-stack and other related repositories.

## Purpose

- Store reusable code modules and libraries
- Provide common utility functions
- Enable consistent implementation of shared functionality
- Reduce code duplication across the project

## Contents

This directory will contain:

- Utility functions
- Helper classes
- Shared data structures
- Common algorithms
- API client libraries
- Other reusable components

## Usage

Libraries in this directory should follow modular design principles and be well-documented to facilitate reuse.
